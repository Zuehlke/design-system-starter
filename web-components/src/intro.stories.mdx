# Design System Starter

## Get Started

Design System Starter is a reusable component library. All components are native web components, which allow to be used
in any framework.

## React

For current React versions there is a separate "wrapper" package to make it easier to use:
`@design-system-starter/web-components-react`.

### Tailwind

The package `@design-system-starter/tailwind-preset` provides a configuration for using the design system in TailwindCSS
is provided. There the standard Tailwind constants are overwritten with the design tokens of the design system.
The usage is simple via configuration presets:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('@design-system-starter/tailwind-preset')
  ],
  content: [
    './src/**/*.tsx'
  ]
};
```

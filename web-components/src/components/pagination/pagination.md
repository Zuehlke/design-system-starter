## Interaction
* The paginator allow to navigate between different pages in a dataset.
* The paginator shows the 5 pages 'closest' to the currently selected page.
* Icon buttons allow to navigate to the previous, next, first and last page.
* At this stage, shortcut to navigate to a specific page is available.

## Usage
* Use only with big data sets like tables or long lists.
* If there is a good way to filter data efficiently, this should be chosen over add all data in combination with a paginator!
* Pagination usually is not ideal from a UX perspective, but sometimes necessary to handle large data without performance issues.

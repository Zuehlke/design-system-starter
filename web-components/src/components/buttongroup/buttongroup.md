## Interaction

* With a button group the user can select one of multiple states. (The function is similar to a drop-down)

## Usage

* Use button groups for a selection from up to 5 options.
* For more than 5 options one should consider a drop-down instead.
* Button groups can be used similar to tabs as well. This way a button group allows to choose what part of an interface
  should be displayed.

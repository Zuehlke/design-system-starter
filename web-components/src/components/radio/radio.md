## Interaction

* Radios allow the user to select at most one out of several options given in a radio group.
* By default, usually no radio button starts out selected.

## Usage

* Use radio buttons when only one option of a group can be selected. Otherwise, use checkboxes instead.
* If the options have a shortname, consider using a button group instead of radios. For long texts radio buttons are
  usually better.
* If there are more than 5 options or the space is scarse, consider using a dropdown.
